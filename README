This is README for my first project (yViewportModificator)

This small library emulates one of the many features which implements the CSS media queries.
Library set class name for body element depending on the width of viewport.
This is similar to CSS media queries feature:
	"media screen and (min-width: 100px) and (max-width: 500px)"
 
All of this actually for browser IE versions less 9 (which not support CSS media queries).
 
For example: 
	Basically you must include only one script into head tag:
	<script type="text/javascript" src="yViewportModificator.js"></script>
   
	Optionally you can set properties:
	<script type="text/javascript">
		yViewportModificator.configure({
		class_mask: 'someclass_',
		widths: [800, 1000, 1500]
 	});
	</script>

   The result for this example will be several options for class names for body element, depending on the current screen width:
   If width of browser's window equal (for example): 
   		- 900px then class name will "someclass_800-someclass_1500 someclass_800-someclass_1000";
   		- 1100px then class name will "someclass_800-someclass_1500 someclass_800-someclass_1000 someclass_1000-someclass_1500".

   
Maintained few of following options:
	class_mask - mask of class name which set for body tag ("body_" by default)
	widths - an array of integer values of the widths of the viewport ([320, 480, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1600] by default)
